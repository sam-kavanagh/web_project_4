# Project 5: Around The U.S.
Around the U.S showcases different states in the U.S.

In this project I've built on project 4, further developing my interactive webpage. 

New features such as the 'Add' pop-up have been implemented allowing users to add their favourite places to the images(via weblink) on display, and name them. Users can also now like like and delete places.

Javascript forEach was used for the first time in this project to help with the addiiton of the cards to the page. Similarly to project 4, querySelection and functions were used.
