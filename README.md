# Project 9: Around The U.S.
Around the U.S showcases different states in the U.S.

In this project I've built on project 4 & 5 , further developing my interactive webpage. 

New features such as the 'Add' pop-up have been implemented allowing users to add their favourite places to the images(via weblink) on display, and name them. Users can also now like like and delete places. In addition form validation has been added to the input forms, showing if any requirements are not met.

We worked with objects more in depth in this porject, alongside form validation using; isValid, showInputError,hideInputError,enableValidation function and more EventListeners.

We also introduced keyboard events such as "keydown" and "mousedown", allowing users to close the popups using the esc button and clicking out of the popup box.

Hope you like it!
