# Project 4: Around The U.S.

In this project I developed my first interactive webpage, showcasing different states in the U.S.

In the project I used Javascript for the first time,consisting of; querySelection, functions and and if statement.This allows you to add and amend your profile details; name and description below the header of the page. Followed by a grid of images applied using previous skills learnt such as flexbox and positioning and responsive web design.
